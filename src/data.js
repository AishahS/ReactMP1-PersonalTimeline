    " Hello. My name is Aishah. Along with my day job as an engineer, I am a freelance/hobbyist photographer. My journey in photography took its first major turn when I took a course in photography in 2011, which is also when I did my first photoshoot. I have always loved the rich artistic culture of Kuwait, where I was born, and relish the ability to capture it in my photography. My interests and specialty include capturing the picturesque natural environment, architectural marvels, and the cuisine of my beloved homeland. Along with photography, I also provide photo editing and graphic design services. Please feel free to contact me for creative and unique works of art.",
